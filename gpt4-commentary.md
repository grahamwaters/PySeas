If this were my project, I would keep most of the functions as they are, but I would organize them into a more object-oriented structure to make the code easier to understand and maintain. Here's an example of how I might refactor the code:

Create a BuoyImage class with the following methods:

__init__(self, image): Constructor that initializes the BuoyImage object with the input image.
crop_bottom(self, num_pixels): A method that crops a specified number of pixels off the bottom of the image.
resize_to_standard_height(self, target_height): A method that resizes the image to a target height while maintaining its aspect ratio.
split_into_panels(self, num_panels): A method that splits the image into a specified number of panels.
Create a PanoramicImage class with the following methods:

__init__(self, panels): Constructor that initializes the PanoramicImage object with a list of panels.
detect_horizon_line(self): A method that detects the horizon line in the image and returns the angle of the detected line.
align_horizon_line(self): A method that aligns the image by rotating it to correct the tilt angle of the horizon line.
stitch_images(self): A method that stitches the list of aligned images into a single panoramic image.
Create utility functions for handling common tasks, such as:

mse_between_arrays(arr1, arr2): A function that calculates the mean squared error (MSE) between two arrays.
check_unusual_panels(panels, mse_threshold): A function that checks if any of the input panels have an MSE value greater than the threshold and returns a tuple containing a list of unusual panels and a list of rich-color panels.
download_image(image_url): A function that downloads an image from a specified URL, checking if it's too white and handling failed images.
The code would work together in the following way:

Download an image using the download_image() function.
Create a BuoyImage object with the downloaded image.
Crop the bottom of the image using crop_bottom().
Resize the image to a standard height using resize_to_standard_height().
Split the image into panels using split_into_panels().
Check for unusual panels using the check_unusual_panels() utility function.
If there are unusual panels, create a PanoramicImage object with the list of panels.
Detect and align the horizon line for each panel using detect_horizon_line() and align_horizon_line() methods.
Stitch the aligned images together into a panoramic image using the stitch_images() method.
