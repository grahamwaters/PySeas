# Next Steps

"""

The next steps are to:
Use the Keras model saved in the models folder to predict the content of each panel image as it is created, and save the predictions to a csv file.
These predictions will determine which buoys the model will follow closest and which buoys it will eventually ignore. This will be done by finding which of the buoy cameras record the most interesting content (i.e. the most interesting content will be the content that the model predicts as being the most interesting).



            # daytime images always have higher values than 10 for all three channels
            # values less than 10 are usually night
            # skip the image if it is night
            #if orange_value < 10 and red_value < 10: # if the image is night
            #    continue
            # if the values are all higher than 250 then it is a white image and we want to remove it
            #if orange_value > 250 and red_value > 250:
            #    os.remove(file)
            #    print("Removed white image")
            #    continue
            # interesting photos have high red values
            #if red_value > 147 or (orange_value > 147 and #red_value > 100): # if the image is interesting
            #    add_list.append(file)
            # if the image was not taken in the last x hours, skip it
