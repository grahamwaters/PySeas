    "We want to quickly request the live streams that are running on each of our urls in the urls_list. We can do this by using the requests library. We will use the get() method to request the live stream from each url in the urls_list. We will then use the status_code attribute to check if the request was successful. If the request was successful, we will print the url and the status code. If the request was not successful, we will print the url and the status code.\n",

    "- Another loop will run in parallel to the first loop. This loop will scan the keyframes that are extracted from the current live stream and compare them against the model to determine if they are sunsets or not. If it is a sunset then the webcam url will be stored in the sunsets dictionary as the key with its value \"time of sunset\" as the value. The sunsets dictionary will be saved as a json file.\n"
