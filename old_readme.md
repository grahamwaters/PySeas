### Basics

* Station ID - A 7 character station ID, or a currents station ID. Specify the station ID with the "station=" parameter.
> Example: station=9414290
Station listings for various products can be viewed at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov or viewed on a map at Tides & Currents Station Map
* Date & Time -
The API understands several parameters related to date ranges.

* All dates can be formatted as follows:
yyyyMMdd, yyyyMMdd HH:mm, MM/dd/yyyy, or MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm

One the 4 following sets of parameters can be specified in a request:

* Parameter Name (s)
* Description
* begin_date
* end_date
Specify the date/time range of retrieval
date
Valid options for the date parameters are: latest (last data point available within the last 18 min), today, or recent (last 72 hours)
begin_date and a range

Specify a begin date and a number of hours to retrieve data starting from that date
end_date and a range

Specify an end date and a number of hours to retrieve data ending at that date
range

Specify a number of hours to go back from now and retrieve data for that date range

January 1st, 2012 through January 2nd, 2012
    begin_date=20120101&end_date=20120102
48 hours beginning on April 15, 2012
