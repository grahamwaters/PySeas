# Project PySeas

- Project PySeas I want to make a stunning, evolving art composition out of the images generated every hour by the buoys in the ocean, which the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Association or NOAA maintains. They have an API that allows you to call that API and pull images from buoys worldwide. I want to be able to take those images every hour from the buoys and stitch them together using Open CV in a way that makes it I would like to be able to stitch them together to create a panoramic photo, but not by just concatenating the images because that doesn't always look good. Also, I would like to match the images' horizon lines because the buoy images are uneven due to the waves. It is usually rocking back and forth.

- To accomplish this, I plan to use Open CV's image stitching algorithms to blend the buoy images seamlessly. I will also use Open CV's horizon detection and correction algorithms to ensure that the final panoramic photo looks natural and aesthetically pleasing.
- To make the project even more interesting, I want to add a time-lapse element to it. This means that the panoramic image will evolve over time as the buoy images change. I plan to use Open CV's image blending algorithms to smoothly transition from one shot to the next, creating a dynamic and ever-changing art piece.
- I also want to add an interactive element to the project. I plan to create a website where users can explore the panoramic image and see different sections of it in detail. The website will also include information about the buoy locations and the weather conditions at those locations.
- Overall, my goal with Project PySeas is to create a unique and beautiful art piece that showcases the beauty of the ocean and the power of technology. I can create something extraordinary and captivating by combining the images from the buoys with advanced image processing algorithms.
