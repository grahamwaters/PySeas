# Project Title
## Project Description

When structuring a repository, it's important to keep in mind the principles of clarity, organization, and scalability. Here's a suggested structure for the PySeas repository:

1. **src**: This directory would contain all the source code for the project. It could be further divided into subdirectories based on functionality, such as `data_processing`, `image_generation`, `model_training`, etc.

2. **tests**: This directory would contain all the unit tests for the project. It's a good practice to mirror the structure of the `src` directory in `tests` so it's clear which tests correspond to which source files.

3. **models**: This directory would contain the trained machine learning models used in the project.

4. **data**: This directory would contain the data used in the project. It could be further divided into `raw_data` and `processed_data`.

5. **docs**: This directory would contain all the documentation for the project, including a detailed README, contribution guidelines, and API documentation.

6. **notebooks**: This directory would contain Jupyter notebooks used for development, testing, and demonstration purposes.

7. **scripts**: This directory would contain utility scripts, such as those for data collection, model training, or deployment.

8. **assets**: This directory would contain any static assets used in the project, such as images or fonts.

9. **.github**: This directory would contain GitHub-specific files, such as issue templates, pull request templates, and GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.

10. **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose.yml**: These files would define the Docker configuration for the project.

11. **requirements.txt** or **environment.yml**: These files would list the project's dependencies.

12. **.gitignore**: This file would list files and directories that should not be tracked by Git.

This structure separates different aspects of the project into their own dedicated directories, making it easier for contributors to find what they're looking for. It also scales well as the project grows and more files are added.
