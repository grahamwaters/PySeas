Set up the NOAA API and authenticate the API call to pull images from the buoys every hour.

Use OpenCV's stitching module to automatically align and blend the images from the buoys to create a panoramic photo.

Use OpenCV's computer vision algorithms to detect and classify the images as sunsets. This can be done using a pre-trained machine learning model that has been trained to recognize sunsets in images.

Fine-tune the machine learning model as needed to improve its accuracy in detecting and classifying sunset images.

Display the resulting panoramic photos and sunset images on the main project page for others to view and enjoy.

Continuously monitor and update the project, pulling new images from the buoys and generating new panoramic photos and sunset images as needed.

Optionally, add features to the project such as user-submitted images, voting on the best images, and social media sharing.

Overall, this project involves using the NOAA API to pull images from the buoys, using OpenCV to stitch and classify the images, and displaying the resulting panoramic photos and sunset images on the main project page. Fine-tuning the machine learning model and continuously updating the project will be important for ensuring its success.

# Outline of Horizon Matching

Sure, here are the steps for using OpenCV's cv2 and stitcher modules to match the horizon lines in the images from the buoys:

Import the cv2 and stitcher modules from OpenCV.
Copy code
import cv2
from cv2 import stitcher
Use the cv2.imread() function to read in the images from the buoys.
Copy code
img1 = cv2.imread("image1.jpg")
img2 = cv2.imread("image2.jpg")
...
Create a list of the images and use the stitcher.Stitcher.create() function to create a Stitcher object.
Copy code
images = [img1, img2, ...]
stitcher = stitcher.Stitcher.create()
Use the stitcher.stitch() function to stitch the images together, specifying the pano_size parameter to match the horizon lines of the images.
Copy code
panorama = stitcher.stitch(images, pano_size="match_horizon")
Use the cv2.imwrite() function to save the resulting panoramic image.
Copy code
cv2.imwrite("panorama.jpg", panorama)
Overall, these steps involve using the cv2 and stitcher modules from OpenCV to stitch the images from the buoys together, matching the horizon lines in the process. This will result in a seamless panoramic image that captures the beauty of the ocean.

# Reasons we care

There are several reasons why businesses might see value in the analysis of images from the buoy network. Some potential benefits include:

Improved weather forecasting: By analyzing the images from the buoys, businesses can gain a better understanding of the current weather conditions at sea, which can be used to improve weather forecasting and make more informed decisions about shipping routes and operations.

Monitoring of marine life: The images from the buoys can be used to monitor the health and behavior of marine life, providing valuable insights into the effects of climate change and other environmental factors on ocean ecosystems.

Detection of oil spills and other environmental hazards: The images from the buoys can be used to detect oil spills and other environmental hazards, allowing businesses to take action to mitigate the damage and protect the ocean.

Better understanding of ocean currents and wave patterns: By analyzing the images from the buoys, businesses can gain a better understanding of ocean currents and wave patterns, which can be useful for a variety of applications such as wave energy generation and ship routing.

Overall, the analysis of images from the buoy network offers a range of potential benefits for businesses, including improved weather forecasting, monitoring of marine life, detection of environmental hazards, and better understanding of ocean currents and wave patterns.
