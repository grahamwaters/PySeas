    "This code appears to be a Python script that downloads images from buoys, crops them, and checks the colors of each image. It looks like the main function is check_colors_of_six_panels, which takes an image as input and returns the number of panels in the image that meet certain color criteria.\n",

    "One suggestion for refactoring this code is to improve its readability and modularity. You could do this by breaking up the code into smaller, well-named functions that each perform a specific task. For example, instead of having all the code in a single function, you could create separate functions for downloading the images, cropping them, and checking their colors. This would make the code easier to understand and maintain, and would also allow you to reuse these functions in other parts of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another suggestion is to use more descriptive and consistent variable names. For example, instead of using abbreviations like img_width and img_height, you could use more descriptive names like image_width and image_height. This would make it easier to understand what the variables represent and would also improve the readability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, refactoring code involves making changes to the structure and organization of the code to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance. The specific changes you make will depend on your goals and the challenges you are facing with your code. It can be helpful to take a step back and think about what you want your code to do, and then make changes that will help you achieve those goals."
